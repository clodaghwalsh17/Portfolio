This was a group java programming assigment which I completed in Semester Two of First Year.
The project consists of a .java file of methods that allow for the creation of the word search puzzle,the formatting of the puzzle, 
the allocation of words to be used in the puzzle, and display options.
This project includes a file reader to select words to be used in the puzzle.
